### pwntools

pwntools is a python library used to automate and standardise the exploitation of binaries. To get started, my recommendation is to read my high level overview, then get further details through the [online tutorial](https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools-tutorial) provided by the creators of the library. This should provide a solid understanding of the libraries core functionality, which can be expanded upon by reading the [official documentation](https://docs.pwntools.com/en/latest/index.html). Another useful resource is this [cheat sheet](https://gist.github.com/anvbis/64907e4f90974c4bdd930baeb705dedf) for common tasks you will perform with pwntools.

There are two types of tubes we will be interested in for this tutorial: process tubes and remote tubes.
