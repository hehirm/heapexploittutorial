# Tools

This section will introduce some common tools used by binary exploit writers, and enough information about them to understand the *Exploits* section. Note that this section is really a starting point for learning about these tools - it is strongly advised to go beyond the information provided in this section. The tools presented have capabilities that exceed the limited time and resources I have to write this, not to mention the plethora of other fantastic tools available. I have tried to leave links to resources that will further your understanding where possible.
