# Exploits

The fun truly begins in this section, as the knowledge we have accrued gets applied to heap exploitation challenges. Both exploits in this section come from the picoCTF challenge. *cache_me_outside* is an elementary heap exploit, perfect for those that have never done it before (its the first one I solved!). *zero_to_hero* introduces some new concepts, and is more similar to a true competition level heap exploit.
