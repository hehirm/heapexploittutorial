# Introduction to the Heap

In this section we will look at the usage and implementation of the heap. *What is the Heap?* will introduce the heap by comparing it to its little brother, the stack. *Heap Mechanics Part 1: Allocation* will begin our exploration in to the inner workings of the heap by looking at how it handles requests for memory. *Heap Mechanics Part 2: Deallocation* will round out the discussion by covering how the heap recycles memory that is no longer needed.

### Further Resources

These resources were instrumental in developing my understanding of the heap. In particular check out the azeria-labs links, which go into more detail than I do.
