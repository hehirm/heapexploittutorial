# Heap Exploitation Tutorial

In this tutorial I will introduce you to the art of heap exploitation, a powerful subcategory of binary exploitation. The content is divided into three sections:
- The *Heap Introduction* section will get you familiar with the heap and how it works.
- The *Tools* section will introduce the tools that will be used for exploitation.
- The *Exploits* section contains detailed write ups of challenges from the picoCTF suite.

 It is my hope that after reading this you will have at the very least learnt something about the heap that you can apply to future programming and exploiting

### Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes some knowledge of C and python programming. It also assumes that the user will be running Linux, so I would advise using a virtual machine if this isn't your native operating system. Topics relating to processes, virtual memory and threads are discussed but not mandatory to know in depth. It is also strongly recommended to have some prior familiarity with the heap, although this should come with knowledge of C programming.
